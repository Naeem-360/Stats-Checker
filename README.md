# File Info Checker

A Python-based GUI application built with Tkinter to check file metadata and display it in a visually appealing, borderless window with a snow animation. This tool allows users to select a file and view details such as last modified time, last accessed time, and file mode, all within a custom-designed interface.

## Features
- **File Metadata Display**: Retrieve and show file information (e.g., last modified, accessed, changed times, mode, and group ID) using `os.stat`.
- **Custom GUI**: A borderless window with a rounded silver-gray interior and black edges, draggable by clicking the black edges or silver area.
- **Rounded Buttons**: Simulated rounded buttons for "Browse File," "Check Info," and "Close" using canvas ovals.
- **Snow Animation**: Animated snowflakes falling across the window for a decorative effect.
- **Non-Resizable**: Fixed window size (500x400 pixels) with no resizing capability.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed on your system (tested with Python 3.13).
- **Tkinter**: Comes pre-installed with Python. No additional installation required.
